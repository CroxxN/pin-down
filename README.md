<p align="center">
<img align="centre" src="images/pin.png"/>
<img src="images/magnet.png" width="100px" style="margin-left=20px;"/>

- It was born out of frustation while I was reading a complicated post or blog (I don't remember which) and I had to scroll to a part of the website time and again.

- This extension aims to solve that issue. It works like a physical thumb pin. You can pin a specific part of website and return to that part without constant scrolling or mental breakdown.
